Analysing a dataset of:<br>

>    - 30315 rallies over <br>
>    - 714 games<br>

Comparing the timeout-calling team's rally win rates before and after the timeout, results indicate taking a timeout improves performance by approximately 8%, on average.

That improvement rate is captured by the metric "TOboost" in the table below.  Because the serving side is at a disadvantage (winning only 42% of all rallies), the suffixes _srv and _ret pertain to only serving and returning rallies, respectively.<br>

Each timeout is individually scored based on the difference between the team' rallys win percentage before and after the timeout.<br>

The rallies included in the calculation for any given timeout are rallies in the game (not match) before and after the timeout, bounded by any other timeouts.  This bounding was applied because other timeouts are opportunities to change strategy, and thus counteract the impact of the timeout at hand.

Example calculations are provided for a sample game below, with rallies for one particular timeout highlighted in yellow in the figure on the left.

The figure on the right is just a more detailed record of the game's progress, including the server #, sideouts, etc.  Whereas the figure on the left is a simplified view with only the rally winners depicted:<br>

Effect of timeouts on unbroken point scoring streaks, i.e. consecutive rallies won by serving team. (note that a streak of 0 in the far left columns essentially reflects the disadvantage of being server, as the percentage of 0-length serving win streaks is indeed the percent of all rallies won by serving team, and it is below the 50% for a fair contest.<br>

Pro teams ranked by effectiveness of timeouts, where timeout score is the product of their (timeouts per game) and their (average rally win rate improvement after a timeouts), normalized from 0 to 100:<br>
