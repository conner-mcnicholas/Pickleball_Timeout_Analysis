Each timeout is individually scored based on the difference between the team' rallys win percentage before and after the timeout.<br>
Domain of rallies in scope for any given timeout is bounded by any other timeouts that occur in the game.<br>

Effect on a serving opponents ability to maintain unbroken point scoring streaks (note that a streak of 0 in the far left columns essentially captures the general likelihood of a serving team winning any single rally. In that sense it reflects the disadvantage of being server, considering the rate is below 50%, and an even contest would be 50/50 for each side.):<br>

Pro teams ranked by effectiveness of timeouts, where timeout score is the product of their (timeouts per game) and their (average rally win rate improvement after a timeouts), normalized from 0 to 100:<br>
